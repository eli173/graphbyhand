## Graph by Hand

https://eli173.github.io/graphbyhand

This tool allows you to bypass tedious input of vertices and edges for your graphs and instead use drawing tools to create your graph on a canvas, which you can then export to a nice representation that can likely be dropped into your code with only trivial modifications.

An example output:
```
V = {1, 2, 3, 4}
E = {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}
```
